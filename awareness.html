                Challenges of Plastics Recycling
            </h1>
            <p>
                With how many types of plastics there are today, recycling each type of plastic in the most
                efficient way possible has become increasingly more difficult. In his book Recyling, Finn Arne
                Jorgensen at one point discusses this complexity. He notes how "“The challenge with plastics 
                recycling is that technically, there is no such thing as plastic. There are instead many different 
                plastics, each with different material qualities. [...] Each type of plastic requires different 
                processing for recycling." This is why with recyling its not only important to just recycle,
                its important to focus on recycling correctly.

                Spreading Environmental Awareness
            </h2>
            <p>
                One strategy for increasing recyling within a group of people is increasing the amount of
                environmental awareness in that group. T.Y. Cheung and her research team found in a study they
                did on how a student's knowledge, attitude, and intended behaviours affected their recycling
                behaviours. Cheung, et al. found that “research has shown that the new generations have to 
                prepare themselves by acquiring the environmental awareness and knowledge that would allow 
                them to make appropriate decisions." This means it is important for people to understand the
                environmental awareness around recyling in order to understand its significance.
