            <p>
                As individuals, you have the ability to make an impact on a smaller scale. 
                Your everyday actions may have more of an effect than you think. 
                Incorrect recycling can lead to bins getting contaminated, which ultimately causes the entire bin to either have to be sorted out, or it is no longer recyclable.

                Recycling programs vary slightly even just from city to city, and can vary tremendously between states. 
                Since the majority of students at the Claremont colleges are from out of state, many people are not familiar with the rules and regulations to recycling and composting in California, let alone the city of Claremont specifically. 
                If we make a small effort at orientation to clarify what is recyclable here on campus and what isnâ€™t, we believe we could help save many recycling batches from being rejected and sent to the landfill.
